 I am currently a Research  Fellow at Nanyang Technolgoical University. I obtained my Ph.D. degree from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China. I prefer to work on applying cryptographic techniques in building secure protocols to solve problems in real application scenarios. My current research intertests focus on different topics related to AI Security and Privacy.
